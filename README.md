# NESTER
Simple script to lay parts out flat in Fusion 360.  This is not an "official" app, rather something I have been working on as a hobby.
It is specifically useful for use with a CNC Router, Laser Cutter, or other 2D manufacturing techniques.
I use it to take all of the parts in a design and ley them out flat.
